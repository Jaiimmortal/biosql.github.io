Extension modules are optional, and only needed for storing or retrieving the respective data types it accommodates. Language mappings should not expect these modules to be present if only core-schema data types are being persisted or retrieved.

==PhyloDB==
A PhyloDB extension module for storing phylogenetic trees and taxonomies has been under development since December 2006 (started by Bill Piel and Hilmar Lapp at the [http://hackathon.nescent.org/Phylohackathon_1 Phyloinformatics Hackathon]). 

The module is in pre-release status. An [http://code.open-bio.org/svnweb/index.cgi/biosql/checkout/biosql-schema/trunk/doc/biosql-phylodb.pdf ERD is in the repository], as are a number of [http://code.open-bio.org/svnweb/index.cgi/biosql/view/biosql-schema/trunk/sql/phylodb-topo-queries.sql topological queries against the schema]. The schema module has undergone considerable extensions at the [http://hackathon.dbcls.jp BioHackathon 2008], and is still subject to changes.
