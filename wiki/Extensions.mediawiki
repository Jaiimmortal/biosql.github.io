Extension modules are optional, and only needed for storing or retrieving the respective data types it accommodates. Language mappings should not expect these modules to be present if only core-schema data types are being persisted or retrieved.

==PhyloDB==
A PhyloDB extension module for storing phylogenetic trees and taxonomies has been under development since December 2006 (started by Bill Piel and Hilmar Lapp at the [http://hackathon.nescent.org/Phylohackathon_1 Phyloinformatics Hackathon]). 

The module is in pre-release status. It has undergone considerable extensions at the [http://hackathon.dbcls.jp BioHackathon 2008], and is still subject to changes.
