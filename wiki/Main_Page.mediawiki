==About BioSQL==

BioSQL is a generic relational model covering sequences, features, sequence and feature annotation, a reference taxonomy, and ontologies (or controlled vocabularies). 

While in its original incarnation (in 2001) conceived by Ewan Birney as a local relational store for GenBank, the project has since become a collaboration between the [[bp:Main Page|BioPerl]], [[biopython:Main Page|BioPython]], [[bj:Main Page|BioJava]], and [http://bioruby.org BioRuby] projects. The goal is to build a sufficiently generic schema for persistent storage of sequences, features, and annotation in a way that is interoperable between the Bio* projects. Each Bio* project has a [[#Language Bindings|language binding]] (object-relational mapping, ORM) to BioSQL.

===Schema Overview===
A good introduction to the core BioSQL schema and it's intended use is the [[Schema Overview|schema overview]] document.

* [[Extensions|Extension modules]] extend the core schema and are optional unless specifically needed for storing or retrieving the respective data types the module accommodates. At present, there is one extension module, PhyloDB, for storing phylogenetic trees and taxonomies.
* Supported RDBMs are at present PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, HSQLDB, and Apache Derby for the core schema.

== Downloads & Releases ==

We are currently in the process of releasing the 1.0 version of the core schema. A [[Releases|detailed release plan]] with status information is available. The PhyloDB extension module has not been released yet and is only available from the [http://code.open-bio.org/svnweb/index.cgi/biosql/browse/biosql-schema/trunk Subversion repository]. [http://open-bio.org/wiki/SourceCode#Downloading_and_updating_code_via_Anonymous_SVN Instructions for downloading code from anonymous svn] are on the O|B|F wiki; the URL for the main trunk of BioSQL is <code>svn://code.open-bio.org/biosql/biosql-schema/trunk</code>.

The [[Downloads]] section has links to downloads for current and past releases as well as pre/alpha-releases.

== Documentation ==

''Work is underway to migrate the documentation from the code repository to this website.''

* See the [[Schema Overview|schema overview]] for an overview of the BioSQL model. In addition, see the documentation in the [http://code.open-bio.org/svnweb/index.cgi/biosql/browse/biosql-schema/trunk schema SVN repository], especially [http://code.open-bio.org/svnweb/index.cgi/biosql/view/biosql-schema/trunk/INSTALL INSTALL], and documents in the [http://code.open-bio.org/svnweb/index.cgi/biosql/browse/biosql-schema/trunk/doc doc/] subdirectory.
* Instantiating the schema and pre-populating it with the NCBI taxonomy or other data are extensively documented in the [http://code.open-bio.org/svnweb/index.cgi/biosql/view/biosql-schema/trunk/INSTALL INSTALL] file in BioSQL (MySQL and PostgreSQL), the [[biopython:BioSQL|BioSQL page at the BioPython wiki]] (MySQL), and the [http://code.open-bio.org/svnweb/index.cgi/biosql/checkout/biosql-schema/trunk/doc/bj_and_bsql_oracle_howto.htm Biojava/BioSQL HowTo] (Oracle).
* See [[Optimizations|possible optimizations of local BioSQL installations]].
* BioSQL add-on modules are documented as [[Extensions|Extension modules]] (and the repository may hold additional documentation for them, too).

== Bug Reports & Enhancement Requests ==

We are in the process of adding a BioSQL category to the O|B|F Bugzilla instance. Until then, please simply report bugs directly to the BioSQL mailing list at [mailto:biosql-l%40lists%2eopen-bio%2eorg biosql-l&#64;lists&#46;open-bio&#46;org].

This wiki documents [[Enhancement Requests|enhancement requests and which BioSQL version they are scheduled]] to be incorporated in (if they have been scheduled yet).

==Language Bindings==
The Bio* projects provide object relational mapping from their respective object models to BioSQL. Details for each project can be obtained from the links below.

* [[BioJava BioSQL ORM|BioJava]]
* [[bp:Bioperl-db|BioPerl]]
* BioRuby
* [[biopython:BioSQL|BioPython]] (this also contains excellent documentation for installing BioSQL)
