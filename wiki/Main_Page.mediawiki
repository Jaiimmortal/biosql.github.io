The BioSQL project is a collaboration between [[bp:Main Page|BioPerl]], [[biopython:Main Page|BioPython]], [[bj:Main Page|BioJava]],and [http://bioruby.org BioRuby] projects to build a schema for persistent storage of sequences and features.

==Schema Overview==
A good introduction to BioSQL and it's intended use is the [[Schema Overview|schema overview]] document. This was originaly copied from CVS. It will now be maintained as a live document in the wiki.

==Object Relational Mapping==
The Bio* projects provide object relational mapping from their respective object models to BioSQL. Details for each project can be obtained from the links below.

 * [[BioJava BioSQL ORM|BioJava]]

==In Progress==
''Work is underway to migrate the documentation from the code repository to this website.''
