# Update license for BioSQL and all its DDL and software scripts. ''Done. This is now the LGPL license for all schema files. --[[User%3AHlapp|Hilmar]] 20:23, 21 February 2008 (EST)''
#* The current license refers to the 'same terms as Perl' and the Perl Artistic Licence. Not only does Perl now dual-license under Artistic License v2.0 or GPL (because the original Perl Artistic License v1.0 has problems), but also there isn't a good reason to tie the BioSQL license to that of Perl.
# Update, fix, or remove various ancillary files that don't seem to have been touched in a long time.
#* biosql-accelerators-pg.sql ''Updated/fixed, but could be better to remove it. --[[User%3AHlapp|Hilmar]] 20:31, 21 February 2008 (EST)''
#* biosqldb-views-pg.sql ''Done. --[[User%3AHlapp|Hilmar]] 20:31, 21 February 2008 (EST)''
# Rename biosql-ora to biosqldb-ora for consistency with the other schema versions ''Done. --[[User%3AHlapp|Hilmar]] 20:31, 21 February 2008 (EST)''
