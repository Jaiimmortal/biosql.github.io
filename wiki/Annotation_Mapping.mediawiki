This page documents the recommended BioSQL-standard of mapping sequence annotations (through Bio* object models) to the BioSQL relational model.

{| border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"
|-
| DIVISION || column division in table bioentry
|-
| accession numbers || secondary accession numbers go into bioentry  qualifier value table. Primary accession maps to column accession  in table bioentry
|- 
| TITLE || this is part of a publication reference, and should map to  column title in table reference
|-
| VERSION || in BioPerl we parse this apart into a version for the accession (which is column version in table bioentry) and the GI number, which maps to column identifier in table bioentry
|-
| REFERENCE || table reference (and bioentry_reference for association with the bioentry)
|-
| KEYWORDS || map to bioentry_qualifier_value
|-
| GI || column identifier in table bioentry
|-
| SIZE || if it is the length of the sequence, it should map to column length in table biosequence
|-
| DEFINITION || column description in table bioentry
|-
| ORGANISM || this is the organism and maps to the table taxon (and taxon_name), with a foreign key in bioentry pointing to the taxon
|-
| JOURNAL || this is part of a reference, see 'references'
|-
| ACCESSION || the primary accession, maps to column accession in table bioentry
|-
| LOCUS || in the file itself this is an entire line consisting of multiple fields; BioPerl/bioperl-db maps the locus name (the first token after the literal token LOCUS) to column name in table bioentry
|-
| SOURCE || this is the organism, see 'ORGANISM'
|-
| PUBMED || this is part of a literature reference, and maps to a foreign key in the reference table (reference.dbxref) to a dbxref entry with PUBMED or PMID as the database and the pubmed ID as the accession
|-
| AUTHORS || part of a literature reference, maps to column authors in table reference
|-
| TYPE || if this is the alphabet, it maps to table biosequence, column alphabet
|-
| CIRCULAR || this at present maps to bioentry_qualifier_value, though there are plans to make it a column in table biosequence.
