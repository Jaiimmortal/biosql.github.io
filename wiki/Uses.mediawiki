BioSQL has been used in a number of research and database projects. This page aims to document those and accumulate a list of examples.

== Data integration ==

*  BioSQL is the database schema and data model underlying [http://symatlas.gnf.org SymAtlas]. The database runs on Oracle 9i. Bioperl/Bioperl-db is used to import almost all data sourced, and the web-application is implemented using the J2EE technology stack, using JBoss as the application server.

== Genomic data ==

* [http://www.scri.ac.uk/staff/leightonpritchard Leighton Pritchard]: SRCI uses BioSQL "in a database of comparative genomic data for prokaryotes. This involved a small extension of the schema to accommodate mutual relationships between seqfeatures, but essentially it's all BioSQL under the hood."
