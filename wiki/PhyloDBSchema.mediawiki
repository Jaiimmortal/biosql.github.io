This document describes some of the tables and fields in the PhyloDB schema. It also aims to demonstrate functional capabilities using example SQL. Design philosophies and expectations are presented with reasoning.

==TREE==
Tree stores information on individual bifurcating non-cyclic graphs. Trees are uniquely identified by thier "tree_id". They also have a "name" and "identifier". They are associated with a BioSQL biodatabase via their "biodatabase_id". The Boolean field "is_rooted" identifies whether a node is rooted or not. The default is TRUE, i.e. rooted. "Node_id" identfies the ''start'' node which is usually the root node of a rooted tree.

===Questions about TREE?===
#Where do "identifier"s come from?
#What is the role of the ''start'' node except to identify the root?

==TREE_ROOT==
Tree_root stores information on the root node of a tree. Tree roots are uniquely identified by thier "tree_root_id". The tree the root is from is identified by the "tree_id" while the node table record is identified by "node_id". "is_alternate" is TRUE if the root node is the preferential (most likely) root node of the tree, and FALSE otherwise. The "significance" (such as likelihood, or posterior probability) with which the node is the root node. This only has meaning if the method used for reconstructing the tree calculates this value.
