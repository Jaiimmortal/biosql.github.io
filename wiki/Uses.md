BioSQL has been used in a number of research and database projects. This
page aims to document those and accumulate a list of examples.

Data integration
----------------

-   BioSQL is the database schema and data model underlying
    [SymAtlas](http://symatlas.gnf.org). The database runs on Oracle 9i.
    Bioperl/Bioperl-db is used to import almost all data sourced, and
    the web-application is implemented using the J2EE technology stack,
    using JBoss as the application server.

Genomic data
------------

-   [Leighton Pritchard](http://www.scri.ac.uk/staff/leightonpritchard):
    SRCI uses BioSQL "in a database of comparative genomic data
    for prokaryotes. This involved a small extension of the schema to
    accommodate mutual relationships between seqfeatures, but
    essentially it's all BioSQL under the hood."
